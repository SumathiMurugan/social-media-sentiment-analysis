# Social Media Sentiment Analysis using Tableau

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on social media data using Tableau. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. By visualizing this sentiment data using Tableau, we can gain insights into how people feel about certain topics, brands, or events on social media platforms.

## Introduction
This project aims to showcase the process of collecting, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing sentiment data from social media using Tableau. By following the steps outlined in this README, you will be able to recreate the sentiment analysis and visualization on your own social media data.

## Prerequisites
- Tableau Desktop (version X.X or later)
- Python (for data preprocessing and sentiment analysis)
- Twitter Developer Account (for data collection)

## Data Collection
To perform sentiment analysis, we need social media data. In this project, we focus on Twitter data. You will need to set up a Twitter Developer Account and obtain API keys and tokens to access the Twitter API. Use the Tweepy library in Python to collect tweets based on specific keywords, hashtags, or users.

## Data Preprocessing
The collected data may require some preprocessing before sentiment analysis. This includes removing special characters, links, and other noise. You might also need to handle duplicate entries, missing values, and irrelevant columns.

## Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed text data. You can use various sentiment analysis libraries or machine learning models to assign sentiment scores to each text. Common sentiment scores are positive, negative, and neutral.

## Tableau Visualization
1. Load the preprocessed sentiment data into Tableau.
2. Create visualizations like bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, or word clouds to represent sentiment distribution over time, sentiment breakdown by source, etc.
3. Use calculated fields to aggregate and manipulate data for visualization.
4. Add interactivity to your Tableau dashboard, allowing users to filter and explore sentiment data.

## Results and Insights
The Tableau dashboard will visually represent the sentiment analysis results. The insights might include:
- Trends in sentiment over time
- Sentiment distribution by location or demographic
- Most mentioned positive/negative keywords
- Influential users driving sentiment

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to collect, preprocess, analyze, and visualize sentiment data from social media using Tableau. The insights gained from this analysis can provide valuable information for brand management, marketing strategies, and public opinion understanding.
